# Initial Setup for GitHub and Unity
I would highly recommend using GitHub Desktop
1. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRZGeaHPoaw) and this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpXxcvS-g3g), as they explain basic setup.
2. Go to where all of your project files are stored. Create an empty file within this folder. This is now your private repository. 
3. Fetch this Repo into the folder.
4. Within Unity Hub, click "Open", then navigate to the file named "Mental" within the newly imported repository. This contains everything a Unity project needs to function.
5. Make sure you navigate to the Scenes folder in assets then open Main Scene
6. Import Cinemachine asset if it's not already there (as if you don't have it, Unity will give you all sorts of errors) in  Window > Package Manager (All assets) > Cinemeachine.
7.  All set! Everything should be working perfectly. Please contact me in case of an issue.

# Rules
1. Please DO NOT edit files you are not supposed to. This will create merge confilcts and just a big mess.
2. Please check GitHub every Monday and pull this Repository into your personal one.
3. Please explore others' work, but do not edit it.
4. Please comment on issues and feedback in the Issues tab feature.
5. Please be proffesional. This is an environment which calls for this.
6. Please use the Discussions tab. This Repo is connected to everyone on the project, so that's an excellent way of communication.
