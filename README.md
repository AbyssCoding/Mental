# Initial Setup for Git, GitHub, and Unity
I would highly recommend using GitHub Desktop
1. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRZGeaHPoaw) and this video [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpXxcvS-g3g), as they explain basic setup.
2. Be sure that the project you make is a **Universal Render Pipeline Project**
3. Create a local Repository in a new folder wherever all of your Unity Project Files are. Pull the GitHub repo to this folder
4. Import Cinemachine asset (as if you don't have it, Unity will give you all sorts of errors) in  Window > Package Manager (All assets) > Cinemeachine.
5.  All set! Everything should be working perfectly. Please contact me in case of an issue.

# Rules
1. Please DO NOT edit files you are not supposed to. This will create merge confilcts and just a big mess.
2. Please check GitHub every Monday and pull this Repository into your personal one.
3. Please explore others' work, but do not edit it.
4. Please comment on issues and feedback in the Issues tab feature.
5. Please be proffesional. This is an environment which calls for this.
6. Please use the Discussions tab. This Repo is connected to everyone on the project, so that's an excellent way of communication.
