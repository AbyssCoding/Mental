# Initial Setup for Git, GitHub, and Unity
* To get started if you don't have Git, please watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRZGeaHPoaw).
* Make sure you have Unity installed with the latest version. Make sure that all of the project files are located in a folder saved direcly in your local drive.
* Navigate within this folder, and go to your designated main project within Unity, then to the Assets folder. Copy the file location OF THE FOLDER
* Use that file location at the point 6:10 in the tutorial video. This will allow Git to directly interface with your Unity files.
* If you need setup help, don't hesitate to ask for help
